    "Measuring essential soil metrics such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, and pH value is an important aspect of assessing soil condition. But it is an expensive and time-consuming process, and due to budget constraints, farmers sometimes prioritize which metrics to measure. Their primary objective is to maximize crop yield, given the soil condition (and other factors). Each crop has an ideal soil condition that ensures optimal growth and maximum yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I use my machine learning expertise to help a farmer select the best crops for their fields. Specifically, I build multi-class classification models to predict the most suitable `\"crop\"` for each field and assess the most important features for predictive performance."
